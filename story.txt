	Once there was a young CS student enrolled at the Univeristy of
 Wisconsin. He was taking the course CS400 in Birge 113 at 2:30pm on mondays
 and wendsdays. This mans name is Nick. Nick absolutly loves CS400. Nick is doing assignment with his teammates. he made Github. After he made a Github account , he went to CS lab.

	Once nick went to the cs lab, he was unable to login to the cs 
computers because he had memory problems and forgot his password. His memory 
was terrible due to an extremely embarassing accident during his childhood.
